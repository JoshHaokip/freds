## Brief

> Design and build a website for Freds Coffee Shop

My plan was to create a website whereby the focus was placed on the products. In order to achieve this I created a template called Mural - which allowed images to be the focal point of the screen when a user enters. The reason I why I went with this was, from my experience, coffee shops are a very artistic and visual places, therefore, I wanted the website to reflect this.
